# A New Congress

Recently, many ideas for how to make our government less divided have been floating around. Two ideas that have captured my attention are [multimember house districts](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/how-to-fix-politics-in-america/polarization/multimember-house-districts/) and [expanding the size of the House of Representatives](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/how-to-fix-politics-in-america/participation/bigger-virtual-house-of-representatives/).

I live in Kentucky's 6th congressional district, where in the last election, Republican Andy Barr beat Democrat Amy Mcgrath with 51% of the vote. While I personally would rather be represented by a Democrat, there's something else about this that I find troubling which is that Andy Barr, who has represented my district since 2012 has established a solid coalition of conservative voters that will reliably reelect him every two years. The other 49% of voters in his district (including me) are not represented. From his perspective, why should Barr care about my concerns? I'm never going to vote for him anyway, and supporting more progressive policies would anger his core voters. 

Multimember house districts address this problem. Here’s how it would work. All districts are expanded to 5 members. Yes this makes the House a lot bigger, but the article above argues that is a _good_ thing. When voters go to the polls they check a box next to a party instead of a candidate (You may argue that this only reinforces the concept of tribalism. My reply would be that voters by-in-large _already_ pay more attention to party than the candidate running). Once all votes are tallied seats are awarded using [the d'Hondt system](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/european-elections/european_elections/the_voting_system.html). To take my own district for example, if this system were in place in 2018, Republicans would earn 3 seats and Democrats would earn 2.

How does this change things? For one thing, it gives more voters a representative who is sympathetic to their concerns. My party would be in the minority, but now I have someone (two someone’s actually) to whom I can direct my concerns. Furthermore, Republican’s now have an incentive to consider the concerns of all of their constituents too. They have three seats now yes, but what if they want to earn 4 in the next election? Listen to the concerns of your people, build a bigger coalition and you are rewarded for your efforts. The result is politicians who are more responsive to their constituents

What about third parties? They too now have an opportunity to win a voice in government if they can earn enough votes. Consider California House District 34, a solid blue district where the democrat won with 72% of the vote and due to California’s [Jungle Primary](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/05/617250124/how-californias-jungle-primary-system-works) the green party candidate took 27% and no Republican was on the ballet. Here, the Greens have significant support and would earn seats in proportion to that support.

Using data from the 2018 House races, I ran the numbers to see what would happen in every house district under this system. Is 2018 data the right starting point? I have no idea, but I wager that any guess about what would happen if we switched to this system would be just that — a guess. Nonetheless this is the data I started from. I also tweaked the numbers a little based on the following assumptions

 - Third parties vote counts are doubled and the same amount is deducted from the party they likely would have voted for in a two party system (more voters break with Dems to vote Green, Republicans break to vote Libertarian, etc.) Under this system, voters know that their preferred party can earn seats even if they don’t earn the most votes. They can vote for whom they like best, not just one of two major parties.

 - No more unopposed elections. Assume that the two major parties are able to put forth a slate of candidates in all districts and a third party participates in areas that are solidly red or blue. In a race that in the data was unopposed, reward at least 1 seat to the opposing major party, and 1 to the likely third party, _unless_ the third party had significant support (winning 2 seats on their own).

The results? Not too different from what actually happened in 2018. Democrats earn a slim majority of seats (52.92% compared to 54.0% in real life) They are in control for now, but have to be careful to not lose power. The only difference now is that Gerrymandering becomes much more difficult if not impossible. Everyone’s voice is heard.
